Widzimy, że tylko 20 artykułów, ma wszystkie 15 najczęściej pojawiających się słów z artykułu obamy(ale wspólne słowa również dla artykułu Barria), jest to mała liczba. Zobaczmy na to, że słowa, które sprawdzamy są wspólnymi słowami występującymi u Obamy i Barria w artykółach, widzimy, że mało jest artykułów, które miały by te same słowa co te dwa artykuły. Ja to interpretuje w ten sposób, że już te dwa artykuły razem wziętę dość dobrze zawężają nam zbiór podobnych artykułów do tych dwóch."

Widzimy, że wyniki są o wiele bardziej sensowne, artykuły tearz zbliżone są nie tylko tym, że mamy polityków, ale także ludzi rzeczwyiście zbliżonych do siebie jeśli chodzi o szczegóły. Widzimy, że TF-IDF, przypiusuje jakby 'wage' do każdego z licznika słów w bag of word. Te żadko wystepujące dostają większą wagę(zgodnie ze wzorem z wykładu), a te częste jak np 'the' dostają wagę o wiele niższą. Widzimy, też, że od razu zmiejszyła się liczba artykółów, które mają dokładnie taką samą liczbę najczęstszych słow w artykule obamy(analogicznie jak wyżej), ale tym razem artykóły te są bardzo do siebie podobne(wygooglowałem sobie i rzeczywiście dostaliśmy dobrą rekomendację). Istotnie również odległości od artykułów są relatywnie wyższe niz jak braliśmy 10000 słow, ale jest to oczywiste, bo podwyższając wymiar odległość między punktami zazwyczaj nam wzrośnie(klątwa wielowymiarowości)"

(Zastanawia mnie czy to zostałoby naprawione jeżeli użylibyśmy normalizacji, choć wydaję mi się, że nie usunelibyśmy całkowicie tego problemu to jednak troche byśmy go złagodzili, oczywiście wtedy zrównamy(patrząc na podobieństwo) krótsze i dłuższe artykuły, ale chyba wyniki byłyby bardziej sensowne i rozrzucone?). Istotnie widzimy, że metryka cos, radzi sobie lepiej niż euklidesowa, ona działa trochę inaczej, bo zamiast bazować głównie na odległości między wektorami to skupia się na ich kierunku. To tłumaczy dlaczego jest lepiej, jeśli chodzi o długośc artykułów oraz co dostajemy jako podobne artykuły. No tylko właśnie, kładzenie nacisku na kierunku ma swoje konsekwencje..."

Co istotne, dostajemy bardzo fajnie zróżnicowane artykuły pod względem długości + są one zbliżone do siebie sensem. Rozwiązaniem jest to co Pani Profesor zaproponowała powyżej, czyli ograniczenie z góry i dołu długości dokumentu, żeby kiedy szukamy artyukłu nie dostać pracy doktorskiej, albo wpisy na twitterze. "
